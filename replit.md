### Streamlined 6-Step Workflow Implementation (September 2025)
- **Workflow Simplified**: Reduced from 8+ steps to 6 clean steps with focus on seasonal visualization
  - Step 1: Welcome (location & climate)
  - Step 2: Site Details (dimensions & orientation)
  - Step 3: Interactive Design (unified plant selection & placement)
  - Step 4: [Hidden] 3D rendering for AI reference only
  - Step 5: Seasonal Generation (integrated date selection → progress → viewer)
  - Step 6: Final Review (gallery, batch downloads, sharing)
- **Core Focus**: Seasonal images are now the primary output - no single static view option
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Combined plant selection and placement into split-panel Interactive Design step

  - Social sharing capabilities and project archiving
  - Progress indicator shows only 6 visible steps (Step 4 hidden from users)

### AI Design System Architecture & Safety Fixes (September 2025)
- **AI Implementation**: Uses Anthropic Claude API for garden design generation (not in-house solution)
- **Fixed Logic Error**: Moved safety preferences from manual design to AI design approach
  - AI design now properly asks for plant safety preferences (toxic, thorny, irritant avoidance)
  - Manual design no longer shows safety preferences (users can filter themselves)
- **Added Abuse Prevention**: Implemented reasonable limits for premium tier
  - Free tier: 1 design total
  - Pay-per-design tier: 1 design per style
  - Premium tier: 50 designs/month, max 10/day (was previously unlimited and vulnerable to abuse)
- **Fixed Navigation Alignment**: Step numbers now align horizontally with consistent min-height containers

### AI Photorealization Optimization - Automatic Minimal Markers (September 2025)
- Implemented automatic photorealization mode in Garden3DView for improved AI accuracy
- Replaced complex 3D geometries (cones, spheres) with minimal white dot markers
- Research showed complex shapes were causing AI to preserve geometric forms instead of generating accurate botanical species
- Minimal markers: pure white dots on black background with no other visual elements
- Technical implementation: 16x16 pixel sprites, NearestFilter, depthTest=false, renderOrder=999
- Automatic activation: Mode enables automatically when generating AI visualizations
- Canvas capture: System captures minimal marker image and sends to Gemini for reference
- User transparency: Mode is completely hidden from users - no visible toggle or indication
- Result: AI has maximum freedom to generate plants from botanical text descriptions without geometric bias
- **Fixed scene clearing issue**: Properly removes old meshes when switching to photorealization mode
- **Black background enforced**: Photorealization mode now shows ONLY white dots on pure black background
- **Fixed orientation mirroring**: Added explicit coordinate system instructions to prevent left-right flipping
- **Enforced exact plant counts**: Multiple verification points prevent AI from inventing extra plants
- **Added garden bed boundaries**: Visible edge/border requirements for clear garden definition
- **Improved background blur**: Heavy blur with 90/10 garden-to-background ratio for minimal distraction

### Database Restructuring for Numeric Dimensions (September 2025)
- Added numeric dimension fields to plant schema for precise measurements
- Primary storage in metric units (centimeters) with secondary Imperial units (inches)
- Fields added: heightMinCm, heightMaxCm, spreadMinCm, spreadMaxCm (and Imperial equivalents)
- Successfully migrated existing text-based dimensions to numeric values
- Updated advanced search to use numeric filtering for accurate height/spread ranges
- Frontend now displays dimensions in metric format (meters) as primary measurement system

### Navigation Improvements (January 2025)
- Added persistent navigation sidebar to garden properties form for unrestricted navigation
- Users can now freely navigate to any page using the sidebar while creating a garden
- Maintained required field validation with clear red asterisk indicators
- Kept auto-save behavior based on user tier: always enabled for paid users, optional for free users with default opt-in
