# German Nursery Scraping Test Results

## Initial State (Before Fixes)
- **Plants in database**: 311 total plants
- **Unique external IDs**: 309
- **Scraping status**: Failed with 671 plants attempted, 0 saved

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Force Parameter ✅
- Added `force` parameter to allow re-scraping completed URLs
- Can now override "completed" status to retry scraping

### 2. Product Discovery Improvements ✅
- Fixed collection URL detection (extracts from any URL path)
- Increased page limits: 10 → 50 pages for JSON API
- Increased HTML scraping pages: 30 → 50 pages  
- Better pagination handling with proper URL construction

### 3. Bulk Upsert Improvements ✅
- Replaced manual duplicate checking with atomic `onConflictDoUpdate`
- Uses externalId as unique constraint for efficient upserts
- Better error handling and logging

### 4. Route Updates ✅
- Route now accepts `force` parameter
- Improved logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

To test the improved scraping:

1. **Clear any existing progress** (Already done)
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM scraping_progress WHERE url LIKE '%graefin-von-zeppelin%';
   ```

2. **Run scraping with force parameter**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/scrape-plant-data \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "url": "https://www.graefin-von-zeppelin.de/collections/stauden",
       "saveToDatabase": true,
       "force": true
     }'
   ```

3. **Monitor progress in logs**
   - Should see: "Total unique product URLs found: ~1010"
   - Should process in batches of 10
   - Should save/update plants incrementally

4. **Verify results**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM plants;
   -- Expected: ~1000+ plants (accounting for some duplicates)
   ```

## Expected Outcomes
- ✅ Discover ~1010 product URLs
- ✅ Process all products in batches
- ✅ Save/update plants with proper conflict resolution
- ✅ Final database should have close to 1010 plants

## Notes
- The scraping will take some time due to rate limiting (300ms between products)
- Some plants may be duplicates across collections
- Progress is tracked and can be resumed if interrupted
