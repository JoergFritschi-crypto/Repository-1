Okay, once we have reached the step where Gemini 2.5 preview flash enters the picture, literally speaking, what I need as a UI is a full-page viewing window with YouTube controls, but no automatic advancing of the images. We need—I think we have that on the testing tool side already—control over the period. That is, when should the first image begin? By half month: first half of March, first half of July, and so on. And when is the last image produced? And that's exactly at the beginning, not evenly spaced, of that given bracket. Then I need to be able to choose how many images I want: one, two, three, four, five, six. For the moment, six should be the max. I have experienced that many more do not change a whole lot. Of course, if I want to, I can have the first image from the first of January and the last on December 31st. Also, there's a tier user limit: free users get one image, paper design users get six, but with limited iterations if they want to go back and change. It will probably be like three iterations, and premium users are basically free with a reasonable max as well. If someone makes hundreds of images, it's going to ruin my account. Let's make that max thirty images per design and ten iterations. That's still a lot and reasonable. Of course, we would need to define when this is reset. Let's make that twenty-four hours for a reset in premium users, so there's a cap somewhere. Then we'll need to decide which images are saved automatically. I don't think we should do that. I think we should let the user clearly, manually save the images to their file, at least when the browser is closed. As long as the browser is open and the session is ongoing, there's probably no need, since all images are saved anyway. But for later use, we would have to probably make it very clear that you need to save that series. Let's make it the whole series that was produced, not each image. The free user is informed that their design and image are saved for seventy-two hours; they can come back, become a paper design customer, and then still get their material. Now, I'm open to suggestions—whether that's either too complicated, not reasonable, and if you have some other suggestion, please feel free.
