Core Garden Styles to Offer
Romantic/Country Garden: Known for lush, informal plantings, flowing pathways, and abundant blooms (roses, lavender, peonies), embracing English and French country influences for a cozy, timeless atmosphere.

Classic/Formal Garden: Emphasizes symmetry, geometric layouts, clipped hedges, defined borders, and focal points like statues or water features. Often inspired by European traditions (Italian, French, Baroque).

Karl Foerster Type/Contemporary Perennial Garden: Characterized by naturalistic plantings, ornamental grasses (especially Calamagrostis 'Karl Foerster'), robust perennials, and an ecological, modern approach. It blends wild and designed elements, focusing on sustainability, year-round interest, and plant-driven composition.

Cottage Garden: Informal, romantic mix of flowers (foxgloves, delphiniums, clematis), climbing plants, pastel colors, and hidden nooks, encouraging biodiversity and sensory appeal.

Mediterranean Garden: Drought-tolerant species, terracotta materials, aromatic herbs (rosemary, thyme), and warm color palettes evoke relaxed Mediterranean living.

Modernist/Minimalist Garden: Clean lines, geometric spaces, architectural plants, minimalist plantings, and materials like concrete, steel, and glass for a contemporary look.

Japanese Garden: Subtle, tranquil designs using rocks, water elements, moss, and carefully pruned plants for meditative and balanced outdoor environments.

Additional Styles Worth Considering
Gravel/Rock Garden (xeriscape, alpine, or desert plants)

Woodland/Ecological Garden (shade-loving, native plants, low-maintenance)

Tropical Garden (exotic foliage, bold colors)
