Sub-task checklist:

Inspect your database schema to verify tables and columns mentioned.
Identify conflicts with Supabase Auth best practices and Replit ID approach.
Propose a safe migration strategy (or alternative) and generate SQL accordingly.
Warn about destructive/unsafe changes and confirm before proceeding.

Sub-task checklist:

Compare the requested ALTERs with your actual schema.
Flag anything that will break Auth or fail to run.
Propose a safe migration that works with Replit IDs without rewriting PK types.
Provide ready-to-run SQL for the safe path; ask confirmation for destructive path.
Key findings from your schema

profiles.id is uuid and has a foreign key to auth.users.id. Changing it to text will break that FK and anything relying on Supabase Auth.
The agent’s script mentions columns that do not exist in your DB:
climate_data.user_id — not present
todo_tasks.user_id — not present
api_alerts.user_id — not present
security_audit_logs.target_user_id — not present
Many tables already reference profiles(id) as uuid:
gardens.user_id, user_plant_collections.user_id, plant_doctor_sessions.user_id, design_generations.user_id, api_usage_stats.user_id, file_vault.user_id, security_audit_logs.user_id, active_sessions.user_id, active_sessions.revoked_by, ip_access_control.added_by, security_settings.last_modified_by, security_recommendations.dismissed_by, rate_limit_violations.user_id.
Dropping trigger on auth.users and function handle_new_user():
There is no such trigger/function in your project, and altering objects in the auth schema often requires elevated permissions. Those DROP statements will either no-op or fail with permission denied.
Recommended approach (safe, aligns with Supabase best practices)

Keep Supabase Auth with uuid primary keys.
Add a separate column on profiles to store Replit’s text user ID. Do not change PK/FK types.
Use this column in your application to map Replit users to the Supabase auth user.
Run this migration:

Adds a unique text column for Replit IDs.
Would you like me to run the following?

Add a replit_id column on profiles with a unique constraint.
Optional: add an index on email if you rely on it for lookups (you already have a unique constraint).
If yes, I’ll execute:

ALTER TABLE public.profiles ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS replit_id text UNIQUE;
Why this is preferable

No breakage of auth.users linkage or existing RLS/policies.
You can onboard users from Replit by:
Creating a Supabase auth user (uuid).
Inserting/updating the matching row in public.profiles with profiles.id = auth.users.id and profiles.replit_id = '<replit user id>'.
Your app can query profiles by replit_id and still enjoy RLS and Supabase tooling.
If you still want to convert everything to text IDs

This is destructive and will disconnect profiles from auth.users. You will need to:
Drop the FK profiles.id -> auth.users.id.
ALTER profiles.id to text.
ALTER all dependent FK columns to text and recreate constraints.
Update all RLS policies that compare auth.uid() (uuid) to user_id to account for type change (or you’ll lose RLS protections for authenticated access).
The real list of columns to change in your project (based on your schema) is:
public.profiles.id
public.gardens.user_id
public.user_plant_collections.user_id
public.plant_doctor_sessions.user_id
public.design_generations.user_id
public.api_usage_stats.user_id
public.file_vault.user_id
public.security_audit_logs.user_id
public.active_sessions.user_id
public.active_sessions.revoked_by
public.ip_access_control.added_by
public.security_settings.last_modified_by
public.security_recommendations.dismissed_by
public.rate_limit_violations.user_id
Columns mentioned by your agent that do not exist and would cause errors if you ran their script:
climate_data.user_id
todo_tasks.user_id
api_alerts.user_id
security_audit_logs.target_user_id
Confirm if you want me to draft the full conversion script; I’ll include safe ordering (drop constraints, alter types, recreate FKs, update RLS), but I strongly advise against this path unless you’re fully abandoning Supabase Auth.
Next step

Confirm which path you want:
Recommended: Add profiles.replit_id text UNIQUE and keep UUID PKs.
Destructive: Convert PK/FKs to text and sever the Auth FK.
I’m ready to run the migration for option 1 immediately on your confirmation.
