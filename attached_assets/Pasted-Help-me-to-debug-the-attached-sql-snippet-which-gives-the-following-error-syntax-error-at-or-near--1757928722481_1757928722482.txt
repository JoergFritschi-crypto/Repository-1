Help me to debug the attached sql snippet which gives the following error:

syntax error at or near "============================================="

=============================================...


Sub-task checklist:

Identify the exact syntax error and show the minimal fix.
Point out other blockers that will cause failures in Supabase.
Suggest concise corrections aligned with Supabase/Postgres best practices.
Root cause of the error
Postgres is failing on the very first line because it’s not a valid SQL statement. The divider line is not commented.

Problematic line: " ============================================="

Minimal fix
Comment out the decorative dividers (or remove them). Example:

SQL Query



-- =============================================
-- GardenScape Pro - Supabase Database Schema
-- =============================================
-- This script creates all necessary tables for the GardenScape Pro application
-- Compatible with Supabase PostgreSQL
--
-- Tables included:
-- - User management (users, sessions)
-- ...
-- =============================================

Once the first non-comment line is valid SQL, the parser will proceed.

Additional issues to address (Supabase-safe)
Extensions:
Install in the extensions schema: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto WITH SCHEMA extensions; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp" WITH SCHEMA extensions;
You’re using gen_random_uuid(), which comes from pgcrypto. You don’t need uuid-ossp unless you use uuid_generate_v4(). Pick one.
Auth/users table:
Supabase already provides auth.users. Don’t create your own users table for auth data. Recommended: create public.profiles with user_id uuid references auth.users(id).
Data types:
Prefer uuid over varchar for IDs and default gen_random_uuid() (or uuid_generate_v4()).
Prefer text over varchar for free-form strings.
Prefer timestamp with time zone for time fields.
RLS policies:
Add TO clauses (e.g., TO authenticated).
Remove OR auth.uid() IS NULL from SELECT policies; that makes data readable to anonymous clients.
For UPDATE/DELETE, include USING (and WITH CHECK for UPDATE/INSERT).
Indexes for FKs:
You added many—good. Ensure all FK columns have indexes (e.g., revoked_by, last_modified_by, dismissed_by).
Triggers:
Your update_updated_at_column trigger is fine; consider using timestamptz columns to match NOW() which returns timestamptz.
Grants:
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO service_role; is fine in Supabase, but remember service_role bypasses RLS. Keep policies strict for authenticated/anon.
If you want, I can provide a cleaned version of your script that:

Comments the dividers
Uses uuid + timestamptz + text
Replaces users with profiles linked to auth.users
Fixes extensions schema
Tightens RLS with TO authenticated and without anon leaks
