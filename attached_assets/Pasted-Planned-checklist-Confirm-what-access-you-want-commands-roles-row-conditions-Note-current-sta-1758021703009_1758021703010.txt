Planned checklist:

Confirm what access you want (commands, roles, row conditions).
Note current state: RLS is disabled on public.security_recommendations.
Propose policy patterns and SQL.
After you confirm, I’ll enable RLS and create the policy.
I see public.security_recommendations exists and RLS is currently disabled. Before creating a policy, we must enable RLS. What behavior do you want? Please specify:

Which commands: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Which roles: anon, authenticated
Row condition: e.g., admin-only, public read, or “users can dismiss and only see their own dismissed rows,” etc.
Common options you can choose from:

Public read for everyone:
SELECT TO anon, authenticated USING (true)
Admin-only full access (JWT claim user_role = 'admin'):
SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE TO authenticated USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role') = 'admin')
Allow authenticated users to dismiss items and mark who dismissed them:
UPDATE TO authenticated USING (true) WITH CHECK (dismissed_by = (SELECT auth.uid()))
Only allow a user to update rows they dismissed:
UPDATE TO authenticated USING (dismissed_by = (SELECT auth.uid())) WITH CHECK (dismissed_by = (SELECT auth.uid()))
If you confirm one of these (or describe your own), I’ll apply it. For example, to enable RLS and allow public read plus admin-only write, I would run:

Enable RLS: ALTER TABLE public.security_recommendations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

Public read: CREATE POLICY "Security recs public read" ON public.security_recommendations FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated USING (true);

Admin-only write: CREATE POLICY "Security recs admin write" ON public.security_recommendations FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK ((auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role') = 'admin');

CREATE POLICY "Security recs admin update" ON public.security_recommendations FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role') = 'admin') WITH CHECK ((auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role') = 'admin');

CREATE POLICY "Security recs admin delete" ON public.security_recommendations FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role') = 'admin');

Confirm your desired behavior and I’ll create the exact policy statements.
